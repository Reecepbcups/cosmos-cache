# v0.0.8 -> v0.0.10

This upgrade brings a new .env file & removes the redis dependency. Please modify your .env file to take effect.

```sh
# Install the latest dependenies.
python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt --upgrade
```

## Config Changes

```toml
# Remove
REDIS_URL=...
REDIS_RPC_PREFIX=...
REDIS_REST_PREFIX=...

# Add
DEBUGGING=false
# Saves to a file in this dir on close / open for the KV values.
# Set this to any unique name
STORE_NAME="reeces_juno-1"
```

## The same goes for akash / compose image env files if you use.

## (Docker) Worker Threads

You can now set the number of threads you want in docker. Useful for akash deployments with multiple cores.

by default, only 1 thread is used. To expand, more threads, use the following

```env
RPC_WORKER_THREADS=2

and 

REST_WORKER_THREADS=2
```

Where "2" launches 2 threads for each process with its cache
